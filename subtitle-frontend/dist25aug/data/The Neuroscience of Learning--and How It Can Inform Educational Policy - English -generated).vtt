00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.200
my name is barb oakley and i'm so happy

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.200
to be able to give you some insight with

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.160
this video about the neuroscience of

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.320
learning

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.120
and especially how these insights can

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.679
inform educational policy

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.160
after all perhaps the best way to move

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:21.039
teaching and learning onto the 21st

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.359
century is by building on the great

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:25.760
insights that neuroscientists and

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:27.680
cognitive psychologists are providing

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.240
about the brain

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.760
we should begin by getting on the same

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.559
page about

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.960
reviewing what happens in the brain as

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.160
you're beginning to learn

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.320
if we focus on one of the brain's

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.480
fundamental building blocks

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.399
that is the neuron

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.000
we can understand some of the most

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:53.280
important aspects of how we learn

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.239
a neuron has these sort of legs

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.680
that

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.079
dangle off it they're called dendrites

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.039
i show three dendrites here but there

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:05.199
are actually there can be hundreds

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:06.960
and there are these little toes that

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.439
emerge off of the

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.600
dendrites these toes are called

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:13.840
dendritic spines

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.280
and then we have a sort of arm that

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.080
comes up above

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.600
that's called an axon

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.479
when you're learning

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.880
neurons are sending electrical signals

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:27.680
to each other making a little web of

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.600
connections in long-term memory in the

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.200
neocortex

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.520
a lot of times you'll hear that you

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.600
don't need to memorize anything because

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.079
you can always look it up

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.320
but could you speak french for example

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:42.159
if you were always looking it up on

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.560
google translate

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:47.360
could you take derivatives in math if

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.360
you always had to look up how to do it

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.159
no of course not

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.040
you need key aspects of whatever you're

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:57.600
learning in long-term memory for you to

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.560
be able to truly have learned anything

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.360
new

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.960
and for you to gain expertise in any

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.960
topic

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:09.599
now learning often involves practice

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.760
practice is what helps strengthen those

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.840
neural connections as you can see

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.360
metaphorically here

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.239
so ultimately

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.120
those sets of links become sort of like

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.319
this

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.720
big thick nice necklace that you can

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.800
easily pull into mind whenever you've

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.360
learned something

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.680
so this brings me to an important aspect

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.800
of learning that sometimes people aren't

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.319
aware of

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.760
and that is

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:40.319
what is the most important and powerful

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.879
technique that people can use to learn

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:45.120
most efficiently

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:47.440
i'm going to present four different

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.959
approaches here that are commonly used

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.519
for learning

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.840
what i'd like you to do is just think

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:56.319
which of these four approaches that i'm

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.720
going to present here is the approach

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.720
that you use most often for your

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.080
learning the first technique i'll

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.920
mention is that of rereading

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.840
rereading would make sense as a

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.040
potentially powerful technique for

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:14.080
learning because it involves repetition

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.080
then there's highlighting or underline

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.840
which involves motor neurons as you're

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:22.560
drawing and perhaps thus reinforcing

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.120
whatever is on the page

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.080
or it could be retrieval practice or

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.840
recall for example using a flashcard to

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.680
check and see whether you know the

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.879
information

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:38.080
or it could be creating what's called a

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:40.640
concept map such as the one i show here

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.480
where you write down key concepts of

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.840
what you're learning and then see how

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.920
they integrate together

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.319
hopefully of these techniques you see

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.000
here you have in mind which one you

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:53.599
think is best

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.879
which one is it

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:58.319
well as it turns out it's retrieval

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:01.120
practice

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:03.120
and indeed hundreds of studies have

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.439
shown that retrieval practice is the

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.720
most effective technique for helping

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:08.480
students learn

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.480
not only because it helps students

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.640
remember the material

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:16.160
but because it actually helps build a

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.600
better understanding of the material

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.639
why

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.040
well

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:24.000
when a student is first learning

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.880
something there are these weak links as

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.520
you see here being created in long-term

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.880
memory in the neocortex

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:35.600
but it is when you retrieve that memory

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.360
over and over over time

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.479
those sets of links

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:44.639
those are what help build the strong

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:47.040
links in the neocortex of memory

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:49.520
why does retrieval practice also help

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:52.800
with understanding

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:56.000
well in some sense it's because you're

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:59.919
not only learning what something is

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.400
you're also learning what it is not

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:04.800
now of course some students need more

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.680
retrieval practice with the material to

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.400
learn effectively it all depends on a

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.080
student's pre-existing knowledge base

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.880
their motivation

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.919
and their innate neural underpinnings

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.919
all of which can differ substantially

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:21.840
but even though it can take some

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:25.039
students longer to learn

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:27.199
those slower students like me

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:29.520
can learn the material just as well and

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:31.520
sometimes even better than faster

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.280
students

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.000
but what happens

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.320
if for example a student is very very

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
busy with all sorts of other activities

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.080
and they just don't get around to

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.919
retrieving and practicing with what

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:47.600
they've learned

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:50.080
well in that case they're not using

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:53.280
those particular dendritic spines that

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:56.240
they used for the learning and so

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:59.280
their little synaptic genit

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:01.600
sweep those connections away

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.600
we can actually see this process going

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.319
on in real life

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.080
you're all budding

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:09.919
neuroscientists now so you can recognize

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.440
this as

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:14.639
the leg

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:17.759
of a neuron the dendrite

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:20.560
it's a light microscopy image and this

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:23.120
image was taken before learning and

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:25.759
before sleep you see all these little

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.919
toes the dendritic spines that are

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:28.880
dangling off of it

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:30.400
now

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.080
can you imagine

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:35.360
what would this

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.639
particular living neuron or living

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.919
dendrite

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:41.520
look like

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:43.680
after learning and after sleep

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:46.400
we can actually see it

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:49.120
here's an image of the same living

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.240
neuron after learning and after sleep

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.680
look here

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.639
you can see

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.199
this is

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:59.120
the this lower image

00:06:55.199 --> 00:07:02.240
has a new dendritic spine that's emerged

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:05.199
where there was none before

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:07.520
so it's actually during sleep that

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:08.960
neural connections are really formed and

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.479
strengthened

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.800
this is why it's a good idea for

00:07:10.479 --> 00:07:15.039
students of course after they've learned

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:18.000
the material during the day

00:07:15.039 --> 00:07:20.240
to set aside maybe two to five minutes

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.639
right before they go to sleep to remind

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:24.960
themselves of what they really want to

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:27.759
learn or remember

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:31.360
that will help their neurons to know in

00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:32.639
some sense the ideas concepts or

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:35.280
techniques

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:38.880
that are important to be practicing

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:41.680
during sleep indeed during sleep

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:44.319
those connections are used hundreds of

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:46.000
times as the brain practices with those

00:07:44.319 --> 00:07:48.160
thoughts and activities during the

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.440
sleeping process

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:55.360
so this can be why it's so important to

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:57.280
space out learning over a number of days

00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:00.000
let's say a student has

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:01.680
say five hours for learning involving a

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.479
given topic

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:05.440
they may wish to break that up into one

00:08:04.479 --> 00:08:07.759
hour

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:09.280
per day for five days

00:08:07.759 --> 00:08:12.639
rather than

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:15.120
five hours all crammed in one day

00:08:12.639 --> 00:08:17.840
this one day of cramming

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:20.080
means that the connections are actually

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:23.520
weaker and their little synaptic janitor

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:27.440
can more easily sweep them away

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:30.479
whereas for this spaced repetition in

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.840
learning one hour each day over these

00:08:30.479 --> 00:08:33.760
five days

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:37.680
you not only learn

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:40.399
but you also practice during sleep

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:43.039
so in some sense you're getting twice

00:08:40.399 --> 00:08:45.920
the bang for the buck for your effort

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:47.519
with spaced out learning as opposed to

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:50.000
cramming

00:08:47.519 --> 00:08:52.880
metaphorically speaking since i

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.120
absolutely love metaphors

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:56.880
you can think of it as a little bit like

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:59.120
a brick wall

00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:02.240
you lay a layer of bricks and then

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:03.920
mortar bricks and mortar but before you

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:07.279
go too high

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:10.320
you let that layer of bricks

00:09:07.279 --> 00:09:11.200
dry the mortar to dry

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:13.440
and

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.480
if you take your time with learning like

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:17.360
this

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:19.920
it'll create a very good foundation

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:22.240
if you don't however you're going to get

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:23.760
a structure for learning that looks more

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:27.279
like this

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:29.680
very poor foundation for learning

00:09:27.279 --> 00:09:32.320
this is also irreverently sometimes

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:33.519
referred to as the meathead theory of

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:36.880
learning

00:09:33.519 --> 00:09:39.600
as it turns out both muscular tissue and

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:41.680
neural tissue are excitable tissues

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:43.600
so just as it takes time to build

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:45.600
muscular structure

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:47.519
it takes time to build

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:50.320
neural structure

00:09:47.519 --> 00:09:52.959
of course however some students can

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:54.640
learn much more quickly while others

00:09:52.959 --> 00:09:57.279
much more slowly

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:58.959
just as there are natural athletes

00:09:57.279 --> 00:10:02.240
compared to

00:09:58.959 --> 00:10:05.680
natural klutz's like me

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:08.000
now to another aspect of learning

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:11.120
this relates to what is called working

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.800
memory which involves the limited set of

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:16.000
ideas or thoughts that we can

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:18.320
temporarily hold in mind and work with

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.760
so for example if i gave you the numbers

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:24.240
seven four three and two for you to

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:27.519
remember you would hold them in working

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:28.720
memory by repeating them seven four

00:10:27.519 --> 00:10:31.120
three two

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:32.640
but if you stopped repeating you'd

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:34.560
forget

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:37.680
long-term memory on the other hand can

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:40.000
hold information for a long time but it

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:42.720
can take much more effort to get

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.680
information out of working memory and

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:47.040
into

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:49.760
long-term memory as sets up links that

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:52.000
form those memories

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:54.800
i like to think of working memory as

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.519
kind of like an octopus sometimes i call

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:59.279
it the attentional octopus

00:10:57.519 --> 00:11:02.079
well maybe you'd be better off calling

00:10:59.279 --> 00:11:04.640
it a quadrupos because instead of having

00:11:02.079 --> 00:11:08.240
eight arms to hold information

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:11.120
your working memory has on average only

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:13.360
about four arms

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.959
long-term memory on the other hand is

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:17.600
quite different

00:11:14.959 --> 00:11:19.680
it's more like a locker

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:24.240
and within that locker

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:26.320
is stored all your sets of neural links

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:28.560
you can think of it like this

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:32.000
your working memory

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:34.079
works hard to create sets of links in

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.600
long-term memory about whatever you're

00:11:34.079 --> 00:11:38.160
learning

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:40.640
once working memory has created those

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.760
sets of links and set them in long-term

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:44.000
memory

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:47.680
it can then be easy for your working

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.600
memory to reach out and grab those sets

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.480
of links

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.320
so

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:55.600
this brings me

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:58.639
to my younger daughter rachel

00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:01.040
now not before this little video snippet

00:11:58.639 --> 00:12:04.800
was filmed that you're going to see

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:07.200
rachel had learned how to back up a car

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:09.839
so i asked rachel if she might model for

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:12.320
us on video what it felt like when she

00:12:09.839 --> 00:12:13.760
was first backing up a car

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:16.560
here she is

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:18.399
modeling what it felt like

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:20.000
watch her little face as she's trying to

00:12:18.399 --> 00:12:22.320
back up the car

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
notice how she's looking to the side she

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:26.639
looks up front she looks at us she's

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.880
looking behind her her working memory is

00:12:26.639 --> 00:12:31.760
overwhelmed she doesn't really know what

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:34.639
to do and then of course she ends up

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:37.440
heading off towards the ditch

00:12:34.639 --> 00:12:40.240
this gives us a sense of the process

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:42.639
that occurs as people are first learning

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:44.720
something especially if that something

00:12:42.639 --> 00:12:46.800
is rather complex

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:50.480
their working memory is trying to

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:52.560
integrate all this different information

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:55.040
so you can think of it as their working

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:57.920
memory has what's called a heavy

00:12:55.040 --> 00:13:01.360
cognitive load and that means that the

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:03.040
arms of their attentional octopus

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:05.040
are already full

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:07.519
there's not room in their working memory

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:09.760
for any other information

00:13:07.519 --> 00:13:11.920
so if i was sitting beside rachel i

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:14.399
would not be asking her as she's

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:17.440
learning how to back up the car hey by

00:13:14.399 --> 00:13:19.440
the way what are you going to do today

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:22.160
if she also tried to put some

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:23.600
attentional octopus arms around what i

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:26.480
was saying

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:28.720
she could ultimately become completely

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:31.839
overwhelmed and maybe even hit another

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:34.720
car as she was trying to back up

00:13:31.839 --> 00:13:35.680
but once rachel learned how to back up a

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:38.880
car

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:41.199
it became easy for her to do

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:42.800
all she had to do was think hey i want

00:13:41.199 --> 00:13:45.680
to back up the car

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:48.880
she can then pull that memory those sets

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:50.000
of links of how to back up the car to

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:52.720
mind

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.600
she has a light cognitive load in other

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:58.720
words she's got attentional arms

00:13:55.600 --> 00:14:01.680
available for other thoughts like is my

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:03.279
seatbelt fastened or what's the song on

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:05.839
the radio

00:14:03.279 --> 00:14:07.040
so let's turn our attention now to a

00:14:05.839 --> 00:14:09.199
student

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:11.839
let's say that our student is

00:14:09.199 --> 00:14:14.079
sitting down to take an exam and they

00:14:11.839 --> 00:14:16.240
practice well for the exam

00:14:14.079 --> 00:14:18.160
so they sit down they take a look at the

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:19.279
first problem and they go hmm this is a

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:21.600
tough one

00:14:19.279 --> 00:14:24.000
but since they practiced they can

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:26.720
quickly see that certain sets of links

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.519
that they've already learned can easily

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:31.440
connect with other links and still other

00:14:29.519 --> 00:14:34.399
links and boom

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:36.320
suddenly they've solved the problem

00:14:34.399 --> 00:14:38.720
but on the other hand

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:40.480
if students haven't studied using

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:43.040
retrieval practice

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:45.519
they can sit down to a test and what can

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:47.600
happen is surprise

00:14:45.519 --> 00:14:49.760
they realize that where they may have

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:52.240
thought they knew the material

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:54.160
in reality they didn't

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:56.560
in fact when they start to work on the

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:59.680
problem they realize there are no sets

00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:01.600
of links in long-term memory for them

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:03.519
what they thought was in long-term

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:05.040
memory was actually only in their

00:15:03.519 --> 00:15:08.560
working memory

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:10.880
they didn't really know the material

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:13.519
what happens then is that these students

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:14.399
can come to us as teachers and say you

00:15:13.519 --> 00:15:17.519
know

00:15:14.399 --> 00:15:21.199
i suffer from test anxiety

00:15:17.519 --> 00:15:23.760
but it often isn't test anxiety at all

00:15:21.199 --> 00:15:26.720
it's the fact that they have not learned

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:29.040
the material well they haven't practiced

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:30.399
and place sets of links in long-term

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:32.079
memory

00:15:30.399 --> 00:15:34.160
probably the biggest part of the

00:15:32.079 --> 00:15:36.240
challenge for our students is that we've

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.680
never taught them how to study

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:40.079
effectively

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:42.959
they think their lack of ability is due

00:15:40.079 --> 00:15:44.639
to their stress when it actually relates

00:15:42.959 --> 00:15:46.800
to the fact that they haven't learned

00:15:44.639 --> 00:15:48.800
the material properly

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:50.639
and we can make things worse for our

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:52.079
students when we send them off to

00:15:50.639 --> 00:15:54.800
counseling

00:15:52.079 --> 00:15:56.959
which also allows them to procrastinate

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:58.320
which is another frequent problem for

00:15:56.959 --> 00:16:01.279
students

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:04.000
all this instead of teaching them how to

00:16:01.279 --> 00:16:07.279
effectively learn the material

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.600
the reality is the common facet of

00:16:07.279 --> 00:16:12.160
experts of all kinds

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:14.639
is that they have lots and lots of

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:16.959
well-practiced sets of links in

00:16:14.639 --> 00:16:19.839
long-term memory

00:16:16.959 --> 00:16:22.880
now an important idea for teachers is

00:16:19.839 --> 00:16:24.399
that working memory capacities

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:26.639
can vary

00:16:24.399 --> 00:16:28.720
so as i've mentioned a typical working

00:16:26.639 --> 00:16:32.240
memory can hold about four pieces of

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:35.680
information or chunks of information

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:37.680
a chunk can vary in size and content

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:40.720
it's something you know so well you can

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:43.279
easily pull it to mind as a single unit

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:45.920
whether it's for example a section of a

00:16:43.279 --> 00:16:48.480
song you can play well on the piano or

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:51.360
an equation you know how to work with or

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:53.680
a sentence in a foreign language

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:55.199
some people have a lesser capacity

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:58.000
working memory

00:16:55.199 --> 00:17:00.399
for example i've got a lesser capacity

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.519
working memory i'm lucky to be able to

00:17:00.399 --> 00:17:05.839
hold maybe three pieces of information

00:17:03.519 --> 00:17:08.640
in mind at once but of course some

00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:10.720
people have a greater capacity working

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:12.160
memory than just four pieces of

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:14.640
information

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:16.959
my colleague in teaching the popular

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:18.400
course we both teach on coursera

00:17:16.959 --> 00:17:21.120
learning how to learn

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:23.760
is terry sinowski the francis crick

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:26.160
professor at the salk institute

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:28.720
terry is one of only 12 living human

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:31.120
beings who is simultaneously a member of

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:33.840
the national academy of sciences of

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:37.039
engineering and of medicine

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:39.120
terry has an enormously large working

00:17:37.039 --> 00:17:40.880
memory capacity

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:43.039
the difference between us

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:46.880
is that although i can learn what terry

00:17:43.039 --> 00:17:48.000
learns i am generally much slower than

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:50.160
he is

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.799
unless of course it's something i have a

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:54.480
lot of experience with by comparison to

00:17:52.799 --> 00:17:57.280
terry

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:59.280
you might think well yes but what about

00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:01.840
growth mindset

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:05.520
maybe we just haven't improved our

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:07.760
working memory capacity yet

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:09.760
of course having the right attitude

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:12.320
about what we're learning can make an

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:15.039
enormous difference it certainly did for

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:17.600
me what i decided to change my mind back

00:18:15.039 --> 00:18:20.320
in my mid-20s about whether or not i

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:23.039
could learn in math and science

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:26.480
but we have to be realistic about what

00:18:23.039 --> 00:18:28.960
growth mindset actually applies to

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:30.480
i mean if we have two kids with

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:33.039
different heights

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:36.000
growth mindset is not going to make a

00:18:33.039 --> 00:18:38.559
big difference in whether or not one kid

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.760
can become taller

00:18:38.559 --> 00:18:43.919
it's it's a physical characteristic

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:46.320
working memory capacity is also a

00:18:43.919 --> 00:18:48.480
physical characteristic and it's one

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:51.280
that a student can't really change no

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:53.200
matter how hard they try

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:54.400
so let's look

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:57.120
at how

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:59.600
working memory capacity changes as

00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:00.720
students mature when a child is very

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:02.320
young

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:04.720
it turns out their working memory

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:07.120
capacity no surprise

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:09.039
is very small

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:12.240
they can forget what you tell them is

00:19:09.039 --> 00:19:13.840
pretty much as fast as you can tell them

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:15.360
but as children

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:17.919
mature

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:20.880
their working memory capacity gets

00:19:17.919 --> 00:19:22.640
larger until by the time they're about

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:25.679
15 years old

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:28.400
they can hold on average well anywhere

00:19:25.679 --> 00:19:32.559
between maybe three pieces

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:34.400
to five pieces of information in mind at

00:19:32.559 --> 00:19:37.200
once

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:39.360
this means that a typical teacher is

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:42.480
going to have a wide range of working

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:44.320
memory capacities and learning speeds in

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:47.520
their classroom

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:50.280
this is handled today by a technique

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:53.360
known as differentiation

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:54.799
differentiation involves scaffolding

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:57.760
information

00:19:54.799 --> 00:19:59.840
that is breaking information up into

00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:02.799
smaller chunks

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:05.600
scaffolding allows students who grasp

00:20:02.799 --> 00:20:07.200
the material more slowly to still learn

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:09.520
the material

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:12.000
slower learners also benefit very

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:14.000
greatly from more practice with the

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.559
material

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.320
of course this

00:20:15.559 --> 00:20:20.320
step-by-step approach with much more

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:23.520
practice for those with lesser capacity

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:25.679
working memory can take much more time

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:27.440
but what do we do in the classroom when

00:20:25.679 --> 00:20:30.480
we have someone

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:32.960
like for example this who has a

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:34.720
prodigiously large working memory

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:37.039
capacity

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:39.679
a student with such working memory

00:20:37.039 --> 00:20:41.840
capacity can move out of the realm of

00:20:39.679 --> 00:20:43.919
what a typical teacher can handle when

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:46.960
they're trying to differentiate and help

00:20:43.919 --> 00:20:49.440
all the students in their classrooms

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:51.679
thus my colleague terry sinowski was

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:54.400
seen as a troublemaker in his high

00:20:51.679 --> 00:20:56.720
school because he asked a myriad of

00:20:54.400 --> 00:21:00.400
questions that his teachers were often

00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:03.440
simply unable to answer

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:08.159
this brings me to an important topic

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:10.080
called the expertise reversal effect

00:21:08.159 --> 00:21:12.799
it turns out that the more knowledgeable

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:16.799
a student is about a topic

00:21:12.799 --> 00:21:19.600
the less guidance they can need too much

00:21:16.799 --> 00:21:22.159
guidance in these situations actually

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:24.400
impedes their learning

00:21:22.159 --> 00:21:26.000
think about how frustrated students can

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:28.720
get if they

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.039
knew as much or even far more than their

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:32.159
teacher on a topic and yet we held them

00:21:31.039 --> 00:21:35.120
back

00:21:32.159 --> 00:21:37.679
instead of recognizing and honoring

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:40.480
neurodiversity in other words we can

00:21:37.679 --> 00:21:44.000
simply stick everyone in the same slot

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:46.080
and say they must learn identically

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.799
instead of allowing students like terry

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:50.960
to flourish we can frustrate these

00:21:48.799 --> 00:21:54.240
gifted students to such an extent that

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:56.840
the allure of drugs or anything besides

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:59.760
school can become

00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:02.000
overwhelming our school systems need to

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:04.480
accommodate our gifted students like

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.200
terry as well as those who benefit from

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:08.559
slower learning with far more practice

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:10.559
like me

00:22:08.559 --> 00:22:12.559
that's an important part of the

00:22:10.559 --> 00:22:15.679
educational process

00:22:12.559 --> 00:22:17.919
not only to reach those within typical

00:22:15.679 --> 00:22:18.880
standard deviations of how brains

00:22:17.919 --> 00:22:22.000
function

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:23.360
but even those who fall far outside the

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.440
mean

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:27.679
incidentally if you're looking for the

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:28.559
research citations involved in this

00:22:27.679 --> 00:22:32.559
topic

00:22:28.559 --> 00:22:36.400
feel free to go to this url

00:22:32.559 --> 00:22:37.600
so now we come to my favorite athlete of

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:39.679
all time

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:42.400
julius eagle

00:22:39.679 --> 00:22:44.320
julius is from kenya and if you know

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:47.200
anything about kenya you know they're

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:50.000
famous for their long-distance runners

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:52.000
well if you look at julius's arms it's

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.120
pretty clear that he's not a

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:57.280
long-distance runner in fact julius

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:58.799
always wanted to learn to throw the

00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:01.600
javelin

00:22:58.799 --> 00:23:02.960
sadly he couldn't afford to go overseas

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:05.679
and study

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:08.960
at that time there weren't any great

00:23:05.679 --> 00:23:11.200
javelin throwing coaches in all of kenya

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:15.200
so what did julius do

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:17.360
he began watching youtube videos

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:19.360
as it turns out by watching great

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:21.120
instructors on youtube and then going

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:24.720
out and practicing

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:28.320
98 of the time simply doing that

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:30.240
julius became the world champion in

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:32.960
throwing the javelin

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:35.200
this tells us a lot for one thing it

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:37.440
tells us that we can learn things we

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:40.559
never thought we could learn

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:42.880
simply by going online

00:23:40.559 --> 00:23:45.200
julius also shows us some very

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:47.120
perceptive approaches to learning wealth

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:48.400
that we can apply in our own learning

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:50.720
and teaching

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:52.320
what do i mean by this

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:54.400
let's take a moment and look at the

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:56.559
history of education

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:58.640
for thousands of years a typical

00:23:56.559 --> 00:24:01.840
approach to teaching in school was just

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:05.120
to stand up there and lecture for hours

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:07.600
and this made sense it makes sense even

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:09.279
right now you're watching a lecture here

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:11.840
as i speak

00:24:09.279 --> 00:24:14.480
we can't sit around the table together

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:16.080
much as i would love to and converse in

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:18.400
person

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:21.520
but in general going on for many hours

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:24.240
at a time is perhaps not as effective an

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:26.960
approach as it could be in teaching

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:30.320
teachers begin to realize

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:34.080
starting maybe 30 to 40 years ago that

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:36.559
active learning can be very very

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:39.200
beneficial in learning

00:24:36.559 --> 00:24:42.400
so it became a popular notion

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:44.400
very nearly a fad that students only

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:45.679
learn the material when they're actively

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:48.320
looking on it

00:24:45.679 --> 00:24:50.799
so all of a sudden teaching became swept

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:53.760
up in this idea that active learning was

00:24:50.799 --> 00:24:57.360
the only way that students learn

00:24:53.760 --> 00:25:00.240
but what is active learning really

00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:01.200
often it involves only a superficial

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:04.720
notion

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:07.200
of how student brains actually learn

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:10.159
i mean you've already seen here that

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:12.559
retrieval practice which is generally

00:25:10.159 --> 00:25:14.960
and rightly considered a part of active

00:25:12.559 --> 00:25:18.400
learning is very important

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:20.799
but a student has to get those sets of

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:23.760
neural links at least weekly in place

00:25:20.799 --> 00:25:26.720
before they have anything to retrieve

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:29.919
in other words guidance from a teacher

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:33.120
from pages of a book or the pixels of a

00:25:29.919 --> 00:25:36.159
video are still necessary to get

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:38.480
students started in their initial

00:25:36.159 --> 00:25:41.360
placement of sets of links involving the

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:44.880
material into the brain

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:47.440
so at least some explicit explanation

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:48.720
from teachers along with active practice

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:51.520
by students

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:54.240
are necessary for learning

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:56.880
but what's the best mixture

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:58.880
i mean should it be a lot of explicit

00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:00.000
instruction with a with a little

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:03.200
practice

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.720
or a little lecture with lots of active

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:08.400
learning practice

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:13.120
or perhaps we also might have

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:16.000
something that is a mixture of lecture

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:19.120
equally distributed lecture and active

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:22.080
learning frankly researchers really have

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:24.960
little idea of

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:27.360
what the appropriate mixture is of

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:28.880
active learning with lecture

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:31.120
it depends on what your students

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:34.640
backgrounds are their individual traits

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:37.679
and capacities but what we do know based

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:40.480
on plenty of research evidence is that a

00:26:37.679 --> 00:26:43.760
mixture of explanation in active

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:47.440
practice is the best way to go

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:48.559
this explanation active practice mixture

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:50.880
is called

00:26:48.559 --> 00:26:53.360
direct instruction

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:56.720
doesn't this make sense

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:59.600
isn't this what most teachers do mix up

00:26:56.720 --> 00:27:02.240
an explanation with letting students

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:06.559
work actively on the material

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:08.960
and indeed this is exactly what julius

00:27:06.559 --> 00:27:11.039
ego was doing when he was learning to

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:12.159
become a world champion and throwing the

00:27:11.039 --> 00:27:15.039
javelin

00:27:12.159 --> 00:27:18.080
he would pay attention to the video

00:27:15.039 --> 00:27:20.000
and then he would go out

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:20.960
and practice

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.559
watch

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:25.200
and practice

00:27:22.559 --> 00:27:27.760
watch and practice

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:30.399
it was explicit instruction

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:32.880
mixed with active practice and that's

00:27:30.399 --> 00:27:35.760
how he became an expert in throwing the

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:39.440
javelin but what does this all mean from

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:42.320
a neuroscientific perspective

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:44.880
i've mentioned that we create sets of

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:45.919
links in long-term memory when we learn

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:48.559
anything

00:27:45.919 --> 00:27:49.679
but what i didn't mention was that there

00:27:48.559 --> 00:27:52.000
are two

00:27:49.679 --> 00:27:55.360
different pathways that these sets of

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.039
links can be deposited into long-term

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:59.840
memory

00:27:57.039 --> 00:28:02.399
the first pathway involves taking the

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:04.159
information we receive

00:28:02.399 --> 00:28:07.039
from working memory

00:28:04.159 --> 00:28:08.000
as it passes through the hippocampus

00:28:07.039 --> 00:28:09.600
into

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.320
long-term memory

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:14.720
this is called the declarative pathway

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:18.399
it's called declarative because we can

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:22.159
declare it we're consciously aware of it

00:28:18.399 --> 00:28:25.039
this passes through the hippocampus

00:28:22.159 --> 00:28:28.159
there's a completely different pathway

00:28:25.039 --> 00:28:29.600
though called the procedural pathway

00:28:28.159 --> 00:28:32.559
and this

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:34.640
goes through the basal ganglia

00:28:32.559 --> 00:28:37.120
we're often not conscious of things

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:39.840
we've learned procedurally for example

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:41.760
you may make use of

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:44.559
the patterns of your native language

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:47.520
without even being conscious of them

00:28:44.559 --> 00:28:51.200
because you've learned them procedurally

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:54.240
as it turns out both declarative and

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:56.840
procedural sets of links are what allow

00:28:54.240 --> 00:29:00.000
us to learn well and excel in what we're

00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:03.120
learning what do i mean by that

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:06.159
i mean that the links deposited by each

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:07.520
system can have very very different

00:29:06.159 --> 00:29:09.840
characteristics

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:11.520
and you need both types of links to be

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:14.720
able to be fast

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:17.760
intuitive and flexible in whatever you

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:21.360
or your students are learning

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:23.440
now declarative learning as it turns out

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:26.000
can develop through conscious

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:27.919
explanation so you're conscious for

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.440
example of what i'm explaining here

00:29:27.919 --> 00:29:31.039
right now

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:32.720
procedural learning on the other hand

00:29:31.039 --> 00:29:34.960
develops through

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:38.000
lots of practice

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:40.640
practice solving theorems practice tying

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.039
your shoelaces practice playing a song

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:44.880
on the piano skateboarding or speaking a

00:29:43.039 --> 00:29:47.919
new language

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:50.640
procedurally learned information is

00:29:47.919 --> 00:29:52.320
unusual in that you can't explain it

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:54.799
very easily

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:56.640
if you know how to solve a rubik's cube

00:29:54.799 --> 00:29:59.520
for example you

00:29:56.640 --> 00:30:01.200
may or may not be able to explain how

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:03.679
you can solve it

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:06.159
but you can still solve it

00:30:03.679 --> 00:30:08.720
and indeed many children can learn

00:30:06.159 --> 00:30:12.640
really well procedurally even though

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:13.440
they can't learn that well declaratively

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:15.520
so

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:17.440
for example

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:19.919
those on the autistic spectrum can

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:22.799
sometimes learn incredibly well and

00:30:19.919 --> 00:30:25.200
swiftly by learning procedurally

00:30:22.799 --> 00:30:29.440
but if you ask them to stop and explain

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:31.120
every step declaratively well that's not

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:33.279
the way they learned

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:36.080
you can actually kill these students

00:30:33.279 --> 00:30:39.600
interest and desire in learning by

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:42.720
making them stop and use only the

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:43.840
declarative approach to explain whatever

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:46.320
they're learning

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:49.279
because that's not how they learned

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:51.120
again it's the expert reversal effect

00:30:49.279 --> 00:30:52.559
where walking back through what you

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:54.799
already know well

00:30:52.559 --> 00:30:56.320
can kill desire and motivation for

00:30:54.799 --> 00:30:58.480
learning

00:30:56.320 --> 00:31:01.919
the procedural system is often thought

00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:03.679
of as only involving that awful

00:31:01.919 --> 00:31:06.640
rote learning

00:31:03.679 --> 00:31:09.039
but in reality it's at the heart of our

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:12.320
ability to understand and work with

00:31:09.039 --> 00:31:14.159
incredibly complex patterns like that of

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:16.080
your native language which you learn

00:31:14.159 --> 00:31:19.039
procedurally

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:21.120
the beauty of the procedural system is

00:31:19.039 --> 00:31:24.480
that once you've learned something

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:26.559
through it no matter how complex it is

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:29.120
you don't need to worry about it anymore

00:31:26.559 --> 00:31:31.679
because your procedural systems thinking

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:34.720
and problem solving is all done below

00:31:31.679 --> 00:31:37.679
the level of conscious awareness

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:40.960
one can't help but wonder that when it

00:31:37.679 --> 00:31:44.080
came to fairman's last theorem

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:45.279
a to the n plus b to the n is equal to c

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:48.320
to the n

00:31:45.279 --> 00:31:51.440
fermat saw in a procedural system

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:53.679
intuitive glance the way to solve the

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:58.080
problem

00:31:53.679 --> 00:32:00.880
but it took 250 years for the equation

00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:03.039
to be proved declaratively

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:05.279
step by step

00:32:03.039 --> 00:32:07.679
it's generally very slow to learn

00:32:05.279 --> 00:32:08.960
proceed lately and it can take a lot of

00:32:07.679 --> 00:32:11.200
practice

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:13.519
it takes a long time to learn to type

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:16.000
for example but it's very fast once

00:32:13.519 --> 00:32:16.799
you've learned to type

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.320
but

00:32:16.799 --> 00:32:23.600
procedural learning is also inflexible

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:26.000
so for example if my mischievous husband

00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:27.679
went and rewired the different keys on

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.960
the keyboard it would take me a long

00:32:27.679 --> 00:32:33.840
time to relearn how to type

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:37.039
each neural pathway declarative as well

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:39.519
as procedural has its advantages and

00:32:37.039 --> 00:32:41.600
disadvantages in the types of links it

00:32:39.519 --> 00:32:44.320
lays into place

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:45.840
but both types of links can underpin

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:48.080
good learning

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:51.360
keep in mind however that if we try to

00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:54.559
fit every student into a box where they

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:57.760
must learn for example declaratively by

00:32:54.559 --> 00:32:59.679
parroting back rote explanations we want

00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:02.880
them to feed back to us

00:32:59.679 --> 00:33:04.399
we can kill students interest and desire

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:07.360
in learning

00:33:04.399 --> 00:33:09.360
in fact we can erroneously give a high

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:12.320
grade to a student who doesn't

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:14.640
understand how to do a problem at all

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:17.440
just because the student can parrot back

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:19.600
an explanation we want them to give

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:22.320
where on the other hand we may give low

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:25.440
marks to a student who knows how to

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:27.679
solve problems intuitively and correctly

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:30.640
but who can't parrot back the

00:33:27.679 --> 00:33:32.640
declarative explanation a teacher might

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:35.440
demand

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:38.640
interestingly there's evidence that some

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:41.440
students can have an inclination

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:43.519
to learn more declaratively

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:46.799
while other students can have an

00:33:43.519 --> 00:33:48.960
inclination to learn more procedurally

00:33:46.799 --> 00:33:52.480
for example it seems that those with

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:55.760
dyslexia can have a strong tendency to

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:59.039
learn declaratively because there may be

00:33:55.760 --> 00:34:02.240
challenge with some aspects

00:33:59.039 --> 00:34:04.399
of their procedural learning system

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:08.000
on the other hand some students on the

00:34:04.399 --> 00:34:10.720
autistic spectrum may have particularly

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:13.839
pronounced and talented procedural

00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:15.599
systems in other words they learn best

00:34:13.839 --> 00:34:16.399
procedurally

00:34:15.599 --> 00:34:18.800
so

00:34:16.399 --> 00:34:20.960
perhaps these sorts of differences are

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:23.200
what teachers are observing when they

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:24.879
feel that students have different styles

00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:26.320
of learning

00:34:24.879 --> 00:34:29.200
now

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:31.040
each system may provide

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:33.520
distinct gifts when it becomes

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:35.440
particularly strengthened as it is in

00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:39.119
some students with seeming disorders

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:42.560
such as dyslexia and autistic spectrum

00:34:39.119 --> 00:34:45.679
in fact this may be why some nobel prize

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:47.760
winners with dyslexia are able to

00:34:45.679 --> 00:34:49.200
achieve their extraordinary

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:51.760
breakthroughs

00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:54.079
likewise some on the autistic spectrum

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:56.000
have been able to achieve their nobel

00:34:54.079 --> 00:34:59.680
prize winning breakthroughs because of

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:02.320
the strength of the procedural system

00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:05.040
learning through one system as it turns

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:06.160
out can inhibit learning through the

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:09.040
other

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:11.920
so for example insisting that students

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:14.720
learn by being able to declaratively

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:15.760
step by step explain whatever they're

00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:18.160
learning

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:19.839
may impede their ability to learn

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:22.079
procedurally

00:35:19.839 --> 00:35:24.320
this means it can be difficult for them

00:35:22.079 --> 00:35:27.040
to be fast and intuitive in their

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:29.520
handling of mathematical calculations

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:32.160
and procedures for example if they've

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:35.200
not practiced in ways that develop their

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:38.240
procedural sets of links

00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:39.760
also especially for students with

00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:41.680
dyslexia

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:44.000
it can be difficult for them to learn

00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:46.560
math if they're presented with a lot of

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:50.000
verbiage and walls of text

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:54.000
that may seem like a blurred mess

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:56.839
dyslexia in fact has a 40 percent

00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:00.520
overlap with

00:35:56.839 --> 00:36:02.560
dyscalculia let's take a look at a few

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:05.040
extraordinary people

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:07.040
who can enhance our thinking about

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:09.160
neural differences

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:12.480
so here for example we have the

00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:15.040
extraordinary marie curie was thought to

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:17.359
be on the autistic spectrum

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:20.400
and here is my favorite writer growing

00:36:17.359 --> 00:36:22.720
up octavia butler who was bullied

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:25.520
because of her dyslexia

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:28.079
in fact director steven spielberg

00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:31.359
attributes his movie-making prowess in

00:36:28.079 --> 00:36:33.359
part to his dyslexia which slows his

00:36:31.359 --> 00:36:35.680
reading considerably

00:36:33.359 --> 00:36:37.680
and allows him to simultaneously

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:40.400
consider visuals in a way that the

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:42.800
neurotypical person cannot

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:45.200
then there's jack horner one of the

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:47.280
world's greatest paleontologists in the

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:49.680
basis for the main character in the

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:52.000
movie jurassic park

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:53.440
warner flunked out of the university

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:57.440
seven times

00:36:53.440 --> 00:37:00.160
due to his dyslexia he never did finish

00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:03.119
then there's albert einstein also

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:06.240
thought to be on the autistic spectrum

00:37:03.119 --> 00:37:09.760
and muhammad ali dyslexia

00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:13.280
scientist james lovelock creator of the

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:16.480
gaia hypothesis that living creatures

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:18.000
helped create the earth's atmosphere had

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:20.160
dyslexia

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.640
and elon musk

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:25.119
is on the autistic spectrum

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:27.040
can you imagine elon musk already

00:37:25.119 --> 00:37:30.240
thinking at a graduate school level

00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:33.040
while still in elementary school being

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:36.240
forced to think in lockstep with all the

00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:38.079
other fifth grade children unable to

00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:41.119
reach anything like his actual

00:37:38.079 --> 00:37:44.560
capabilities because of high-bound

00:37:41.119 --> 00:37:45.800
regulatory processes that insist despite

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:48.880
profound

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:52.880
neuroscientific evidence to the contrary

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:54.880
that students do not have natural gifts

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:56.800
and talents

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:59.119
but what do all these differences in

00:37:56.800 --> 00:38:00.960
learning approaches and abilities mean

00:37:59.119 --> 00:38:04.000
for teachers

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:06.400
it means it's not a good idea to put all

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.880
students in one teaching box and say

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:11.839
they must all learn the same way

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:15.119
they don't learn in the same way

00:38:11.839 --> 00:38:17.680
it's incumbent on us as a society and

00:38:15.119 --> 00:38:19.920
for us as teachers to make sure we're

00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:22.320
reaching and teaching

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:26.320
neurally diverse students

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:29.200
and allowing them all to flourish

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:30.480
now how can we best teach students

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:33.359
well

00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:34.960
retrieval practice is great for teaching

00:38:33.359 --> 00:38:37.920
students to learn through both

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:40.320
declarative and procedural pathways

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:42.720
spaced repetition also helps students

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:46.000
learn through both pathways

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:48.240
straight explanation or lecture helps

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.079
with declarative learning

00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:52.480
but on the other hand varied practice

00:38:50.079 --> 00:38:55.119
and especially interleaving

00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:57.200
help with procedural learning

00:38:55.119 --> 00:38:59.200
what is interleaving

00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:01.920
it means taking

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:03.040
and mixing closely related ideas

00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:06.320
together

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:08.480
so that students can begin detecting the

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:10.560
differences which are sometimes subtle

00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:14.079
as they're practicing

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:16.640
let's say for example that you have

00:39:14.079 --> 00:39:19.119
problems that use

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:21.040
the geometric distribution

00:39:19.119 --> 00:39:23.760
the binomial distribution and the

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:26.640
negative binomial distribution

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:29.599
typically students might do 10 of each

00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:32.320
type of problem before moving on to

00:39:29.599 --> 00:39:34.400
explore the next type of problem this is

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:36.960
called blocking

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:38.560
but if once students first get the hang

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:41.599
of how to solve a certain type of

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:44.160
problem they start mixing in problems of

00:39:41.599 --> 00:39:45.119
a different type and then yet another

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:47.920
type

00:39:45.119 --> 00:39:50.240
this helps them to start to understand

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:52.880
the differences between the different

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:55.680
types of problems and when to use the

00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:58.000
different problem solving techniques

00:39:55.680 --> 00:40:00.000
what good does it do a student after all

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.440
if they know how to do the geometric

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.400
distribution

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:06.319
and how to do the binomial distribution

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:08.960
but they don't know

00:40:06.319 --> 00:40:11.599
when to use one approach versus the

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:14.480
other off they can go on a final

00:40:11.599 --> 00:40:17.200
examination correctly using

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:19.920
the wrong technique unfortunately

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:22.319
textbooks often supply their problems

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:24.720
using a blocked approach

00:40:22.319 --> 00:40:27.359
whereas students actually learn much

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:30.160
better using interleaving

00:40:27.359 --> 00:40:31.119
so a good teaching approach is to try to

00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:33.599
ensure

00:40:31.119 --> 00:40:35.680
that despite the way that material is

00:40:33.599 --> 00:40:37.839
presented in textbooks

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:40.160
that students are presented with

00:40:37.839 --> 00:40:42.079
interleaved problem sets in whatever

00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:44.880
they're learning

00:40:42.079 --> 00:40:46.880
it's important to remember that when you

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:49.760
eliminate seeming

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:51.760
rote approaches to learning disparaging

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:55.040
these type of approaches by using

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:59.280
phrases such as drill and kill

00:40:55.040 --> 00:41:02.079
you are actually eliminating the easiest

00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:03.920
best way the brain has to handle routine

00:41:02.079 --> 00:41:05.599
learning tasks

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:07.680
instead

00:41:05.599 --> 00:41:11.839
it's best to think of procedural

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:14.160
learning as drill to skill i'd like to

00:41:11.839 --> 00:41:16.400
turn now briefly to touch on a topic

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:19.520
that may seem to have little to do with

00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:21.040
how the brain works and how it learns

00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:23.839
but what i'm going to talk about

00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:26.480
involves such a common and commonly

00:41:23.839 --> 00:41:29.040
misapplied approach to teaching that i

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:31.119
think it's important to talk about it

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:35.680
and that relates to the problem of

00:41:31.119 --> 00:41:36.720
collaborative and team learning

00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:38.400
so

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:40.560
veronica mintz

00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:42.400
is a high school student or was a high

00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:45.280
school student who wrote an op-ed in the

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:46.400
new york times that describes the common

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:50.000
challenges

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:52.079
students incur in today's teaching

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.920
she estimates that

00:41:52.079 --> 00:41:57.119
80 percent of her learning at school

00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:59.920
took place in collaborative teams

00:41:57.119 --> 00:42:02.240
the consequence was that she grew to

00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:05.760
dread school because of her teacher's

00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:08.000
inability to manage students

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:10.079
responsibility for controlling student

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.839
behavior was being foisted off on

00:42:10.079 --> 00:42:14.480
students who had little ability or

00:42:11.839 --> 00:42:17.040
training to deal with the complex issues

00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:20.640
involved in motivating their peers who

00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:22.880
often had no interest in learning

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:26.560
at the heart of the problem of group

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:29.760
learning in school in fact is the idea

00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:32.000
that group learning is a panacea that

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:33.440
generally allows for excitement

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.520
engagement

00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:37.520
and creativity

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:39.760
oh contraire

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:41.359
let me give you an example

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:43.599
when i was going through engineering

00:42:41.359 --> 00:42:46.079
school i was on a team that was tasked

00:42:43.599 --> 00:42:47.599
with designing a high efficiency heat

00:42:46.079 --> 00:42:50.240
exchanger

00:42:47.599 --> 00:42:53.040
the three guys on my team poo-pooed my

00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:55.839
idea instead devising ideas that it

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:58.480
turned out were virtually identical to

00:42:55.839 --> 00:43:00.800
the other ideas in the class

00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:04.000
so when the professor happened to stop

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:06.000
by i mentioned my idea

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.000
he said

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.720
that's very interesting and hasn't been

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:14.480
done before you should try it

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:16.640
grudgingly my team tried the idea

00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:18.800
our heat exchanger turned out to have

00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:22.319
the highest efficiency

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:24.800
heat exchanger of any exchanger that had

00:43:22.319 --> 00:43:27.680
been designed in the 20 years that the

00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:30.880
professor had been teaching that class

00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:33.839
i'm not saying this to blow my own horn

00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:35.520
i'm saying this because in fact

00:43:33.839 --> 00:43:38.000
research has shown

00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:41.040
that it is individuals rather than

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:43.040
groups who are by far the most creative

00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:45.680
when it comes to scientific or

00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:48.800
technological breakthroughs

00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:50.960
one massive review of tens of millions

00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:52.480
of patents and papers found that it was

00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:54.400
one person

00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:56.800
perhaps two or

00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:59.599
at most three individuals working

00:43:56.800 --> 00:44:01.200
together who made truly creative

00:43:59.599 --> 00:44:03.599
breakthroughs

00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:04.800
larger groups could accomplish large

00:44:03.599 --> 00:44:07.760
tasks

00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:09.520
but not truly creative tasks

00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:11.760
so if you're planning to have your

00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:14.640
students work collaboratively

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:17.040
keep in mind that collaboration is not a

00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:22.000
cure-all for creative work

00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:24.000
in fact too much can diminish creativity

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.920
but there's more

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:27.119
there's the biggest challenge in all of

00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:28.319
teamwork

00:44:27.119 --> 00:44:30.640
and that is

00:44:28.319 --> 00:44:34.079
that there will always be some team

00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:37.119
members who do not pull their weight

00:44:34.079 --> 00:44:39.680
to understand this we should step back

00:44:37.119 --> 00:44:43.280
and look at an article in the chronicle

00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:45.280
of higher education by harvard professor

00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:47.680
robert coles

00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:50.079
coles told the story of a young student

00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:52.960
who was working her way through harvard

00:44:50.079 --> 00:44:56.800
by cleaning dorm rooms

00:44:52.960 --> 00:45:00.000
one student let's call him michael

00:44:56.800 --> 00:45:02.160
was a pre-med student who was already a

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.560
successful journalist

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:07.119
michael would rudely and crudely

00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:09.200
proposition this young woman whenever

00:45:07.119 --> 00:45:12.480
she cleaned his room

00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:16.160
what was worse was that both she

00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:19.680
and this student had taken classes in

00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:22.319
morality and ethics together and michael

00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:25.280
apparently had excelled

00:45:22.319 --> 00:45:27.920
so here was this star student a seeming

00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:30.160
paragon of society at harvard

00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:32.800
and the reality was that he learned

00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:36.480
nothing in his ethics and morality

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:40.079
classes despite his top grades

00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:43.599
in fact as this young woman pointed out

00:45:40.079 --> 00:45:47.200
worldwide there are many philosophers

00:45:43.599 --> 00:45:49.839
scientists poets and politicians who

00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:52.319
have experienced plenty of morality

00:45:49.839 --> 00:45:55.280
training through their early lives

00:45:52.319 --> 00:45:58.240
and have gone on to support despicable

00:45:55.280 --> 00:46:00.880
causes and regimes

00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:04.240
in the end this woman resigned from what

00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:06.640
she called fancy phony cambridge

00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:10.160
with her departure harvard lost a

00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:11.440
guiding light in morality while instead

00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:14.240
with michael

00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:16.160
graduating and ethically repulsive

00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:18.240
character

00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:21.040
it's important to remember

00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:24.079
that there will always be a few students

00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:25.599
like michael amongst us and amongst our

00:46:24.079 --> 00:46:28.000
teams

00:46:25.599 --> 00:46:31.280
such students will parry back the line

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:34.560
of morality even as they can take deep

00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:37.599
advantage of those they're working with

00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:40.240
to deal with these kinds of situations

00:46:37.599 --> 00:46:43.520
and also with situations where students

00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:47.280
may be overworked overwhelmed and still

00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:50.160
willing to take advantage if necessary

00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:52.400
you might give students the tools that

00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:55.520
they need through life

00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:58.240
through using a case study

00:46:55.520 --> 00:47:00.800
here's a good example case study that

00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:04.000
may be of help this is how to manage

00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:06.960
yourself on a collaborative team

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:09.359
this brief essay describes a typical

00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:11.920
student who takes advantage of others

00:47:09.359 --> 00:47:14.400
and tell students what to do

00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:16.880
if they find themselves in a team with

00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:19.680
this kind of situation

00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:20.800
this form as well as the others i'll be

00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:23.440
mentioning

00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:26.480
can be found with research citations

00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:28.559
that i point out earlier

00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:31.119
social emotional learning is

00:47:28.559 --> 00:47:33.280
exceptionally important

00:47:31.119 --> 00:47:35.920
talking through a case study like this

00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:38.240
one allows students to understand one of

00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:40.079
the most important aspects of social

00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:42.880
emotional learning

00:47:40.079 --> 00:47:46.319
one that is typically neglected and that

00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:47.920
is the importance of saying no when

00:47:46.319 --> 00:47:50.000
necessary

00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:52.559
learning to put up boundaries is

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:55.119
exceptionally important especially for

00:47:52.559 --> 00:47:57.920
young girls who are often socialized to

00:47:55.119 --> 00:48:00.240
be empathetic and agreeable

00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:03.119
think about it if you always teach that

00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:06.960
empathy is extraordinarily important

00:48:03.119 --> 00:48:08.400
who's going to listen to and heed this

00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:09.280
message

00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:12.559
well

00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:16.720
it's those who are already empathetic in

00:48:12.559 --> 00:48:19.119
fact by over emphasis on empathy without

00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:21.119
committing training on how to say no and

00:48:19.119 --> 00:48:22.880
set limits in the behavior that we

00:48:21.119 --> 00:48:24.800
accept from others

00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:28.480
we can set students

00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:30.960
especially kind and empathetic students

00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:33.440
up for codependency

00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:34.960
that is the situation where a person can

00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:37.520
put up with almost any kind of

00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:40.000
mistreatment because they think they're

00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:42.160
helping others

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:46.079
there are other ways beyond the case

00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:48.240
study that teachers can use forms and

00:48:46.079 --> 00:48:50.319
checklists to help them better manage

00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:52.720
teams in their classroom

00:48:50.319 --> 00:48:55.200
for example this form

00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:57.599
provides policies for team assignments

00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:59.280
so students know exactly what role to

00:48:57.599 --> 00:49:03.200
play on their team whether it's

00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:05.920
coordinator monitor or checker

00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:08.240
this team expectations agreement can

00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:09.920
help students to sign off on their

00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:12.319
expectations

00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:14.559
signing off together on expectations

00:49:12.319 --> 00:49:17.119
prevents situations where a student can

00:49:14.559 --> 00:49:19.760
claim to have not known what they were

00:49:17.119 --> 00:49:22.800
supposed to be doing or how they can

00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:25.920
contact other students on the team

00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:28.480
this form evaluation of progress towards

00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:31.119
effective team functioning

00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:33.599
allows students to get a sense of how an

00:49:31.119 --> 00:49:36.079
optimal team should be functioning

00:49:33.599 --> 00:49:38.400
including checks to see if their team is

00:49:36.079 --> 00:49:39.920
meeting on time whether they're quickly

00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:41.680
getting on task

00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:42.960
and whether they're listening to one

00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:46.319
another

00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:48.000
this peer reading of team members form

00:49:46.319 --> 00:49:50.400
allows teams

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:52.960
to evaluate one another

00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:55.280
of course this form once it's filled out

00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:56.960
is for your eyes only

00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:59.599
you might be surprised to learn that one

00:49:56.960 --> 00:50:01.839
of the most useful aspects of this form

00:49:59.599 --> 00:50:04.319
is that it allows you to see how some

00:50:01.839 --> 00:50:07.440
students are exceptionally helpful

00:50:04.319 --> 00:50:10.160
behind the scenes where you can't see

00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:14.079
above all it's important to remember as

00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:15.280
my own work on pathological altruism has

00:50:14.079 --> 00:50:18.240
shown

00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:19.440
that over emphasis on the value of

00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:22.960
empathy

00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:24.559
can end up reaching only the already

00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:26.880
empathic

00:50:24.559 --> 00:50:29.680
this can lead to these sensitive

00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:32.960
individuals being taken advantage of and

00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:38.079
bullied and also lead these already kind

00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:40.480
students towards lives of codependency

00:50:38.079 --> 00:50:43.680
let's turn now to an exceptionally

00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:46.240
important idea which as cognitive

00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:48.319
psychologist dan willingham notes with

00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:51.520
his book by that name

00:50:48.319 --> 00:50:53.839
when can you trust the experts

00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:55.760
how can you tell good science from bad

00:50:53.839 --> 00:50:58.240
in education

00:50:55.760 --> 00:51:01.119
as willingham notes educators fall

00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:03.119
primarily into two groups

00:51:01.119 --> 00:51:05.839
those who understand the world through

00:51:03.119 --> 00:51:08.720
reason and those who understand the

00:51:05.839 --> 00:51:11.280
world through experience

00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:13.359
if we look carefully these ideas seem to

00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:16.480
relate to declarative learning as

00:51:13.359 --> 00:51:17.920
opposed to experiential procedural kind

00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:20.640
of learning

00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:23.520
in fact if we look more closely

00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:24.640
we could say that willingham's objective

00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:25.680
reason

00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:27.680
that is

00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:31.200
declarative learning

00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:33.760
is a little bit like this blue box here

00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:36.480
it's going through the hippocampus

00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:39.119
remember we're at least partly conscious

00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:41.280
of what's going on in the working memory

00:51:39.119 --> 00:51:43.760
and onward through the hippocampus as

00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:47.040
declarative learning proceeds logically

00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:51.200
step by step through the hippocampus

00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:54.319
whereas experience that is procedural

00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:57.520
learning is something like this this

00:51:54.319 --> 00:52:00.400
gray box of the basal ganglia

00:51:57.520 --> 00:52:03.760
procedural learning then is sort of a

00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:05.920
misty fog or we're not conscious of its

00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:08.559
influence no matter how profound that

00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:10.800
influence might be

00:52:08.559 --> 00:52:13.839
but there is a difference between these

00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:17.760
two approaches which involves the

00:52:13.839 --> 00:52:19.920
complex nature of the basal ganglia

00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:21.359
now i shouldn't imply that the

00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:25.040
hippocampus

00:52:21.359 --> 00:52:27.680
this hippocampus here is simple

00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:29.760
but we're conscious of our thinking when

00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:31.520
we're using declarative

00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:34.400
hippocampal thinking

00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:36.880
and in this sense it's simpler so if

00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:39.920
we're thinking along here we can think

00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:42.480
logically step by step and we're

00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:45.200
conscious of what we're thinking

00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:46.880
but with this basal ganglia procedural

00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:49.119
learning on the other hand

00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:53.040
we're not conscious

00:52:49.119 --> 00:52:55.599
of this extremely complex system

00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:58.319
this type of learning through the basal

00:52:55.599 --> 00:53:01.119
ganglia develops through plenty of

00:52:58.319 --> 00:53:03.359
practice over and over again so that's

00:53:01.119 --> 00:53:05.920
how you learn to hit a ball or how to

00:53:03.359 --> 00:53:07.680
solve a rubik's cube how you speak your

00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:09.760
native language

00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:12.480
whatever you're learning that is

00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:15.440
processed through the basal ganglia

00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:17.680
generally involves non-conscious

00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:20.640
procedural learning

00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:22.720
now also this procedural system develops

00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:24.559
what's called a

00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:26.880
value function

00:53:24.559 --> 00:53:30.160
this value function develops around what

00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:32.800
is ultimately found to be most rewarding

00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:36.079
in other words the value function of the

00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:38.640
procedural system is like a nest

00:53:36.079 --> 00:53:40.800
of hidden thinking about what is deemed

00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:43.520
optimal for you in the long run

00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:45.680
based on thousands and thousands of

00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:48.720
previous experiences

00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:51.359
inputs what you've seen what you've done

00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:53.920
what you've heard everything

00:53:51.359 --> 00:53:56.640
all of this is wrapped up inside that

00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:59.440
procedural value function

00:53:56.640 --> 00:54:03.119
and this procedural value function

00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:04.480
subconsciously biases your conscious

00:54:03.119 --> 00:54:06.400
thinking

00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:10.319
you may think you are thinking

00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:12.960
completely logically but you're not your

00:54:10.319 --> 00:54:16.640
conscious declarative thinking emerging

00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:19.599
from your working memory and hippocampus

00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:21.839
is biased by your procedural system's

00:54:19.599 --> 00:54:24.079
value function

00:54:21.839 --> 00:54:26.640
let's say that you give a logical

00:54:24.079 --> 00:54:30.160
step-by-step argument to someone you

00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:31.520
think conclusively proves your case

00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:33.520
you think

00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:35.440
that that person is following your

00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:39.680
argument with their conscious

00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:42.559
declarative system and they may be

00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:44.720
but their procedural system is also

00:54:42.559 --> 00:54:47.280
influencing what they're thinking

00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:49.200
and the person is completely unconscious

00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:52.400
of this bias

00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:55.599
in fact this is the source

00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:58.559
of a very common bias which is the

00:54:55.599 --> 00:55:00.480
i'm not biased bias

00:54:58.559 --> 00:55:03.280
let's say for example you have two

00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:05.440
equally trained statisticians and you

00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:07.839
give them a paper on a controversial

00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:11.440
topic of your choice

00:55:07.839 --> 00:55:13.760
one is pro this controversial topic

00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:15.440
and the other is against it

00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:18.480
as you might guess

00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:22.160
when the statisticians read the paper

00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:23.599
they will almost always come up with

00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:25.280
quite different

00:55:23.599 --> 00:55:27.920
conclusions

00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:30.559
if the paper supports their bias they

00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:33.440
will be like oh obviously it's a very

00:55:30.559 --> 00:55:35.359
objective well-designed study

00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:37.280
but if the paper goes against their

00:55:35.359 --> 00:55:39.200
pre-existing bias

00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:42.480
they will find ways to

00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:45.680
poke holes in it and undermine instead

00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:49.200
of accepting its credibility

00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:52.880
these different views on the same exact

00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:55.599
paper are due to the influence of each

00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:58.000
statistician's value function

00:55:55.599 --> 00:55:59.680
which the statisticians themselves are

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:02.079
oblivious of

00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:04.559
or if they're aware of their bias

00:56:02.079 --> 00:56:06.799
they're so completely

00:56:04.559 --> 00:56:09.760
convinced oftentimes that their bias is

00:56:06.799 --> 00:56:11.520
right that they think it's objective

00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:14.079
thinking

00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:17.200
our procedural systems can be shaped not

00:56:14.079 --> 00:56:19.200
only by our experiences but also by the

00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:20.480
training we might receive from our

00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:23.119
education

00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:25.119
the type of media we read or people that

00:56:23.119 --> 00:56:28.000
we're surrounded by

00:56:25.119 --> 00:56:31.280
for example if we learn to associate

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:34.799
certain seemingly benign ideas with

00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:36.880
evil or somehow sinful behavior

00:56:34.799 --> 00:56:40.079
that is our thoughts on this topic have

00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:41.520
been associated with negativity via the

00:56:40.079 --> 00:56:44.000
amygdala

00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:45.200
well that's going to bias our procedural

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:47.520
thinking

00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:50.640
as a consequence when we encounter that

00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:52.400
topic we can't think objectively and

00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:56.079
logically about it

00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:58.400
because of our pre-existing bias

00:56:56.079 --> 00:57:01.119
and because of how our dopamine system

00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:04.480
is set up we can even experience

00:57:01.119 --> 00:57:06.160
pleasure and joy every time we might

00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:08.240
sort of hate on

00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:11.119
the ideas or people we've learned to

00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:13.839
associate with negativity

00:57:11.119 --> 00:57:16.480
it can become natural for some less

00:57:13.839 --> 00:57:18.640
flexible and more dogmatic individuals

00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:20.799
to block out ideas that are

00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:23.599
contradictory because it can be

00:57:20.799 --> 00:57:25.359
reinforcing and pleasurable as they

00:57:23.599 --> 00:57:28.160
reaffirm

00:57:25.359 --> 00:57:31.359
how correct they are in their thinking

00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:33.200
even as they denigrate any conflicting

00:57:31.359 --> 00:57:35.440
ideas

00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:38.640
in this way individuals can find

00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:40.880
themselves no longer being informed by a

00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:43.839
broad spectrum of insights

00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:46.799
instead they can become more and more

00:57:43.839 --> 00:57:49.040
deeply convinced that only their own

00:57:46.799 --> 00:57:51.839
approach is correct

00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:54.480
this phenomenon as it turns out is

00:57:51.839 --> 00:57:55.680
surprisingly common in very intelligent

00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:59.440
people

00:57:55.680 --> 00:58:02.000
in fact as tolstoy once said

00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:04.960
the simplest thing cannot be made clear

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:08.079
to the most intelligent man if he is

00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:10.240
firmly persuaded that he knows already

00:58:08.079 --> 00:58:12.559
without a shadow of a doubt

00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:13.319
what is laid before him

00:58:12.559 --> 00:58:16.000
this

00:58:13.319 --> 00:58:18.880
inflexibility of intelligent people is

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:22.400
part of why research itself

00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:24.799
has shown that science does indeed seem

00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:27.599
to advance funeral

00:58:24.799 --> 00:58:27.599
by funeral

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:32.160
in fact

00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:35.359
it may surprise you to learn that key

00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:37.839
researchers in fact entire groups of

00:58:35.359 --> 00:58:40.079
prominent researchers can become

00:58:37.839 --> 00:58:43.200
inflexibly fixed

00:58:40.079 --> 00:58:45.280
and block progress in an area

00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:47.200
for example alzheimer's research has

00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:49.839
been blocked for years because there was

00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:53.119
a monolithic feeling that one approach

00:58:49.839 --> 00:58:55.440
involving the elimination of amyloid

00:58:53.119 --> 00:58:58.319
plaques was correct

00:58:55.440 --> 00:59:00.640
journal editors major researchers grant

00:58:58.319 --> 00:59:02.799
providers and other leading figures were

00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:04.319
all convinced that they knew the right

00:59:02.799 --> 00:59:06.720
approach

00:59:04.319 --> 00:59:10.079
but their approach was wrong

00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:12.559
amyloid plaques were a symptom not a

00:59:10.079 --> 00:59:15.760
cause of alzheimer's

00:59:12.559 --> 00:59:18.319
it was like researchers combining forces

00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:20.640
to learn how to reduce a person's high

00:59:18.319 --> 00:59:22.880
temperature when they have pneumonia

00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:24.720
instead of actually tackling the

00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:27.280
pneumonia itself

00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:29.839
this scientific group think

00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:32.880
ended up holding back researchers in

00:59:29.839 --> 00:59:35.920
alzheimer's for years

00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:37.920
let's take a tiny mental break here

00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:39.920
and go someplace together that can

00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:41.680
inform us about what's going on in

00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:43.520
education

00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:46.960
where is that somewhere

00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:49.359
the south pole station in antarctica

00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:52.079
it's a bit chilly there i know because

00:59:49.359 --> 00:59:54.880
that's me i used to work there

00:59:52.079 --> 00:59:57.440
actually that's why i met my husband

00:59:54.880 --> 01:00:00.960
so i always like to say i had to go to

00:59:57.440 --> 01:00:03.440
the end of the earth to meet that man

01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:05.920
in fact there's some interesting and

01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:08.799
relevant ideas for education that we can

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:11.200
gain from polar research

01:00:08.799 --> 01:00:13.200
to frame this i'd like to ask you

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:16.799
which of the three things that i'm going

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:18.000
to show you is not like the other

01:00:16.799 --> 01:00:19.760
is it

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.280
lemons

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:24.480
limes

01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:28.079
or polar bears

01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:29.839
well it's actually the limes

01:00:28.079 --> 01:00:31.520
why is that

01:00:29.839 --> 01:00:33.119
to understand the answer to that

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:35.359
question we need to look back at the

01:00:33.119 --> 01:00:37.839
history of scurvy

01:00:35.359 --> 01:00:40.880
in the mid 1700s

01:00:37.839 --> 01:00:44.480
james lund came up with a cure for

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:46.240
scurvy he found that lemons seemed to do

01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:48.960
the trick as you can see from this

01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:51.119
rather overly prettified painting of

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:53.680
people with scurvy

01:00:51.119 --> 01:00:55.760
it took about 50 years for james lone's

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:58.960
findings to make their way

01:00:55.760 --> 01:01:00.319
through common policy into the royal

01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:02.640
navy

01:01:00.319 --> 01:01:05.119
they administered lemon juice to all

01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:07.359
sailors and it cured scurvy

01:01:05.119 --> 01:01:09.680
easy peasy

01:01:07.359 --> 01:01:14.000
but there was a problem

01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:17.359
in the early 1900s polar explorers

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:20.160
started experiencing scurvy

01:01:17.359 --> 01:01:22.000
it turned out that researchers had

01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:24.880
thought they understood how to cure

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:27.680
scurvy but the reality was they didn't

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:28.960
really understand the underlying cause

01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:31.760
of scurvy

01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:32.880
that it involved a deficiency in vitamin

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:35.920
c

01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:40.319
here's robert falcon scott who led the

01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:42.799
first team to the south pole in 1912.

01:01:40.319 --> 01:01:44.400
scott died not long after this picture

01:01:42.799 --> 01:01:47.520
was taken while he was trying to get

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:50.559
back to the edge of antarctica

01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:53.359
scott did a lot of things wrong on his

01:01:50.559 --> 01:01:56.000
expedition but one of his biggest

01:01:53.359 --> 01:01:59.200
challenges may have been that he and his

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:02.480
team came down with scurvy

01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:05.520
but it's so easy to cure scurvy

01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:07.760
how on earth 150 years after the cure

01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:12.000
for scurvy was found

01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:15.359
could people forget how to cure scurvy

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:16.240
simple the cure for scurvy was forgotten

01:02:15.359 --> 01:02:18.960
due to

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:21.599
technological advances

01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:23.520
ships started to go much faster so

01:02:21.599 --> 01:02:26.000
sailors weren't stuck out at sea for

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:28.880
many months at a time

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:31.520
this meant that through the 1800s

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:33.280
as the source of citrus was changed from

01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:34.799
high vitamin c lemons from the

01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:36.880
mediterranean

01:02:34.799 --> 01:02:39.760
to low vitamin c limes from the

01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:41.839
caribbean and copper pipes began to be

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:43.839
used that destroyed what remaining

01:02:41.839 --> 01:02:44.880
vitamin c there was

01:02:43.839 --> 01:02:46.640
well

01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:49.119
no one noticed

01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:50.799
sailors just weren't out at sea long

01:02:49.119 --> 01:02:53.440
enough to get scurvy

01:02:50.799 --> 01:02:57.359
due to the much faster ships

01:02:53.440 --> 01:03:00.240
in fact pretty much only polar explorers

01:02:57.359 --> 01:03:04.319
who were away from the fresh fruits for

01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:07.760
long periods of time began to get scurvy

01:03:04.319 --> 01:03:10.079
especially antarctic explorers because

01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:13.839
polar bears in the arctic

01:03:10.079 --> 01:03:17.839
like lemons but unlike limes are potent

01:03:13.839 --> 01:03:20.640
sources of vitamin c

01:03:17.839 --> 01:03:23.280
the real problem was that technological

01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:25.680
advances in the form of faster ships

01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:26.960
caused problems with the reappearance of

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:29.280
scurvy

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:32.640
this was because researchers hadn't

01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:34.880
truly understood the cause of scurvy

01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:37.680
lund's previous superficial

01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:40.240
understanding of scurby's cure helped

01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:42.160
provide a remedy in the form of

01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:44.319
mediterranean lemons

01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:45.680
but the real cause of scurvy wasn't

01:03:44.319 --> 01:03:48.319
understood

01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:49.839
and technological advances masked

01:03:48.319 --> 01:03:53.200
understanding

01:03:49.839 --> 01:03:55.760
when scurvy was incipient

01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:56.960
wrong-headed practices to cure the

01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:59.760
disease

01:03:56.960 --> 01:04:01.119
consequently begin to be increasingly

01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:03.920
used

01:04:01.119 --> 01:04:07.680
so how is the problem of technological

01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:09.440
advances in some areas that set us back

01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:12.160
in other areas

01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:14.799
relevant for us today

01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:15.760
let's take a look here at calculators

01:04:14.799 --> 01:04:17.839
wow

01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:19.280
we've got a calculator here isn't this

01:04:17.839 --> 01:04:20.400
cool

01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:22.400
you don't have to learn your

01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:25.359
multiplication tables anymore because

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:28.799
calculators will do it all for you

01:04:25.359 --> 01:04:30.720
in fact it can seem intuitively obvious

01:04:28.799 --> 01:04:33.119
that students should just use

01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:35.359
calculators save them the time and

01:04:33.119 --> 01:04:36.640
struggle of learning multiplication

01:04:35.359 --> 01:04:38.640
tables

01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:40.880
this can sound great to those who don't

01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:43.760
really understand how the brain learns

01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:46.480
and the procedural system develops an

01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:49.599
intuition about patterns like those of

01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:52.240
mathematics and language

01:04:49.599 --> 01:04:54.000
more than that let's just use search

01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:56.160
engines because you know we can always

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:58.960
just look it up well

01:04:56.160 --> 01:05:00.400
the reality is that you can't always

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:02.640
just look it up

01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:05.359
in fact as we mentioned the common

01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:08.400
factor of experts of all kinds is that

01:05:05.359 --> 01:05:10.319
they have lots and lots of links in

01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:12.799
their long-term memory

01:05:10.319 --> 01:05:15.760
about the area of their expertise

01:05:12.799 --> 01:05:18.480
whether it's chess math language music

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:21.119
art or what have you

01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:22.400
but the real challenge is that adults

01:05:21.119 --> 01:05:24.559
for example

01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:27.440
really don't remember what it was like

01:05:24.559 --> 01:05:28.480
for them as a child to learn math

01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:30.960
to them

01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:32.559
just using a calculator seems to make

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:35.359
sense because they often don't

01:05:32.559 --> 01:05:37.359
understand how the brain acquires the

01:05:35.359 --> 01:05:40.079
patterns of math

01:05:37.359 --> 01:05:42.480
the the acquisition of expertise can

01:05:40.079 --> 01:05:46.160
involve practice especially retrieval

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:48.559
practice along with spaced repetition

01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:50.880
likewise as an adult your experience as

01:05:48.559 --> 01:05:52.640
a reader is very different than it was

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:55.119
when you were a child when you were

01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:57.760
first learning how to read

01:05:55.119 --> 01:06:00.720
if you don't understand how students

01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:02.559
brains actually learn to read

01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:05.839
you can think that

01:06:02.559 --> 01:06:08.720
joyous whole language approaches where

01:06:05.839 --> 01:06:10.319
kids avoid the repetition of phonics is

01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:13.039
the way to go

01:06:10.319 --> 01:06:15.599
you can believe that no matter what

01:06:13.039 --> 01:06:18.720
research says because it's your lived

01:06:15.599 --> 01:06:21.039
experience as an adult

01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:23.599
the value function of your procedural

01:06:21.039 --> 01:06:25.680
system can bias you to close your mind

01:06:23.599 --> 01:06:28.960
so it doesn't really matter what kind of

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:32.000
objective reason might be put to you

01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:34.720
in fact the technological breakthroughs

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.559
of search engines and calculators which

01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:39.520
are fantastic

01:06:36.559 --> 01:06:42.400
have also misled us because we have not

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:44.480
previously understood at a deep level

01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:46.720
what's going on in the brain when we're

01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:49.280
actually learning things

01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:51.839
it turns out that not

01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:53.039
acquiring the neural patterns needed for

01:06:51.839 --> 01:06:55.039
mastery

01:06:53.039 --> 01:06:58.079
patterns which can involve plenty of

01:06:55.039 --> 01:07:00.559
practice and yes some road learning

01:06:58.079 --> 01:07:02.960
can students abilities to be

01:07:00.559 --> 01:07:05.039
successful long-term in learning a

01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:08.000
subject

01:07:05.039 --> 01:07:12.000
i must close by referring to my favorite

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:15.359
scientist santiago ramone cahall

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:17.440
growing up kahal was basically a

01:07:15.359 --> 01:07:20.640
terrible student

01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:21.640
but this former loser of a student made

01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:24.400
such

01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:27.359
extraordinary scientific breakthroughs

01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:29.359
that he was awarded the nobel prize

01:07:27.359 --> 01:07:31.680
but even more impressive

01:07:29.359 --> 01:07:33.680
kahal is now known as the father of

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:35.280
modern neuroscience

01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:37.119
he was asked

01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:40.160
how did you succeed

01:07:37.119 --> 01:07:43.680
and he said well i was persistent

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:46.079
in other words he practiced a lot

01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:48.319
but the second thing he said was that he

01:07:46.079 --> 01:07:51.839
was flexible

01:07:48.319 --> 01:07:53.760
as he said i have worked with many

01:07:51.839 --> 01:07:57.119
geniuses

01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:59.839
and i was no genius and he was not

01:07:57.119 --> 01:08:02.079
but he said the problem with geniuses is

01:07:59.839 --> 01:08:03.920
that they can jump to conclusions and

01:08:02.079 --> 01:08:06.720
then when they're wrong

01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:10.319
they can't change their minds

01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:13.200
they simply use their intellects to find

01:08:10.319 --> 01:08:15.599
a way to justify why they must have been

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:17.759
right after all

01:08:15.599 --> 01:08:20.400
over and over again we are seeing that

01:08:17.759 --> 01:08:22.960
technological advances in some areas

01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:25.440
such as calculators and search engines

01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:27.040
are actually hindering progress in

01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:29.359
education

01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:31.440
educators without a solid understanding

01:08:29.359 --> 01:08:35.040
of how the brain actually learns can

01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:37.520
inadvertently and sometimes inflexibly

01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:39.040
promote approaches that can hinder

01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:41.759
rather than help

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:44.719
students abilities to learn

01:08:41.759 --> 01:08:47.199
but you on the other hand

01:08:44.719 --> 01:08:48.560
have watched this talk all the way

01:08:47.199 --> 01:08:50.880
through

01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:53.040
i hope with an open mind and a

01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:55.440
willingness to bring solid recent

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:58.960
insights from neuroscience and cognitive

01:08:55.440 --> 01:09:01.600
psychology into education

01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:03.679
it is you who will help bring our

01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:06.080
students to the future

01:09:03.679 --> 01:09:09.199
you have my deepest thanks and the

01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:11.839
thanks of like-minded educators

01:09:09.199 --> 01:09:17.080
and the thanks of the many students you

01:09:11.839 --> 01:09:17.080
will impact in the years to come

01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:28.480
you
